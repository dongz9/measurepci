Understanding the low-level behavior of network interface cards (NICs) is an
important step towards building high-performance networked systems. In this
paper, we study one aspect of this behavior for InfiniBand network cards---the
interaction between the NIC and their PCI Express (PCIe) interface to
CPUs---using hardware counters.  While prior work presents a high-level picture
of this interaction~\cite{Kalia:sigcomm2014}, there is no existing emperical
measurement to the best of our knowledge.

We find two interesting behaviors. First, the PCIe behavior of non-batched and
batched RDMA operations is very different at the requester.  Second, we discover
evidence of a work request cache in the NICs, and suspect that the cache is
malfunctioning in the ConnectX-3 generation of InfiniBand NICs.
