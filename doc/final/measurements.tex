\section{Measurements}
\label{sec:measurements}
We conducted our measurements on the two hardware platforms described in
Table~\ref{tab:platforms}. As both platforms have SandyBridge CPUs, we were
unable to access PCIe counters for MMIO and partial cacheline DMA writes.
These counters are available on Haswell CPUs, and studying them is a part of
our future work.
