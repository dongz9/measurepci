\section{Deliverables and proposed timeline}
\label{sec:design}
The extent of our measurements will depend on the availability of Haswell
servers, and on the PCIe counters that are actually accessible on these servers.
While we believe that we can get access to these machines soon,
some measurements can be done on SandyBridge machines also. For instance,
the counters on SandyBridge machines could be sufficient to verify the model
of PCIe communication used by InfiniBand cards in HERD~\cite{Kalia:sigcomm2014},
and to make some new observations about Ethernet cards. If we do get access
to Haswell machines, we will try to answer the questions outlined above including
other interesting questions that we can think of.

\textbf{Timeline:} We will dedicate the first one month to understanding PCIe
and PCIe device drivers in more detail, and for doing some preliminary
measurements on SandyBridge machines. If we don't get access to Haswell machines
within this time, we will switch to performing more exhaustive testing on
SandyBridge.
