Understanding the low-level behavior of network interface cards (NICs) is an
important step towards building high-performance networked systems. In this work,
we will examine one aspect of this behavior---the interaction between NICs and
their PCI Express (PCIe) interface to CPUs.  While the PCIe interface to a NIC is
often cited as its performance bottleneck~\cite{Han:xia-nsdi2012, zhou:conext2013,
Kalia:sigcomm2014}, the exact steps in the interaction between a NIC and a CPU
are not known. A high-level model for this interaction is well known in the
networking and systems community~\cite{Flajslik:usenix2013}, but the low level
details such as size and number of PCIe transactions, and optimizations such as
write-combining are not well understood.
